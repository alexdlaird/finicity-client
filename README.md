# Finicity Client

This is a Java Finicity Client library for communicating with the [Finicity API](https://developer.finicity.com/admin/docs).

This client is currently in a usable state, and you can download it here, but it is also still being actively
developed. This will be updated when an official release is made available on Maven, but for now, you can use the
artifacts posted here on Github.
